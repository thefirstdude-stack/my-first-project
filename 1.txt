You find a room where the world cannot reach you.
Perhaps it is a bedroom with curtains drawn against the afternoon, or a corner of the house where the floorboards know your weight.
It does not matter where—only that here, in this space you have chosen, no one will ask anything of you.
Close the door.
Lock it, if that gives you peace.
Silence your phone, or better yet, leave it in another room entirely, that small rectangle of obligation that buzzes and demands.
Not now.
Now, you are unreachable.
Now, you are allowed to be a creature of flesh and breath and nothing more.
The temperature should hold you gently—not so warm that you sweat, not so cool that you shiver.
Adjust what needs adjusting.
A blanket nearby, perhaps, in case your body cools as it stills.
The lighting dim, or dark, or whatever shade of shadow feels like permission.
Some prefer a candle's trembling glow.
Others want nothing but the backs of their eyelids.
Trust what calls to you.
This time is yours.
Say that to yourself, if you need to.
This time is mine.
Let the words settle into the space between your ribs.
You have earned this.
Not through productivity or performance, but simply by being a body that carries you through days, that deserves rest, that is allowed—right now, in this moment—to do nothing but exist.
Lie down.
The surface beneath you might be a bed, its mattress remembering the shape of you, or a floor covered in blankets, or a couch that has held you through better and worse nights than this one.
It doesn't matter.
What matters is that your spine can lengthen, that the back of your skull can rest, that your legs can fall open slightly, easy, unguarded.
If sitting serves you better—if your body speaks against lying flat—then sit.
A chair with support for your lower back, your feet flat on the floor, your hands resting palms-up on your thighs like offerings.
There is no wrong way to be comfortable.
There is only your body, and what it asks for.
Adjust your clothing.
Loosen anything that binds—a waistband pressing into your belly, a bra that digs, a collar that sits too close to your throat.
Your body wants room to expand.
Your breath wants no barriers.
Give yourself that looseness, that ease.
You are not performing for anyone.
You are only sinking into yourself.
And now, feel where you meet the surface beneath you.
The weight of your head, cradled.
The press of your shoulder blades, your spine, each vertebra making its own small greeting with what holds you.
The backs of your arms, your hands.
The curve of your lower back—does it lift away, or does it melt toward the ground?
Notice without judgment.
Your buttocks, the backs of your thighs, your calves, your heels.
All these points of contact, these places where your body says yes, I am here, I am held.
Take a breath.
Not a deep one yet—just a breath.
Let it come in through your nose, let it leave however it wants to leave.
Notice the rise and fall of your chest, or your belly, or both.
Notice the pause between exhale and inhale, that small death before the next beginning.
You have been breathing your whole life without thinking about it.
Now, for just a little while, think about it.
The next inhale comes a little slower.
You count it, perhaps—one, two, three, four—or you simply feel it expand you, balloon-slow, the ribs spreading like fingers uncurling from a fist.
And the exhale takes its time.
Five counts.
Six.
The breath becoming honey, becoming thick and golden and unhurried.
No rush.
No destination.
Just this: in, and out.
In, and out.
The exhale is where you soften.
The exhale is where you let go.
Each time the air leaves your body, something goes with it—some tightness you didn't know you were holding, some vigilance you no longer need.
The inhale replenishes.
The exhale releases.
You are a tide.
You are the shore receiving itself, again and again.
Find a rhythm that feels like your own.
Perhaps four counts in, six counts out.
Perhaps a breath so slow you lose count entirely, and that's fine, that's perfect, numbers were never the point.
The point is this: you are slowing.
You are descending.
Each breath takes you deeper, and deeper is where you want to go.
Now bring your attention to your toes.
Not your whole foot—just your toes.
The ten of them, curled or resting, each one a small being at the frontier of your body.
Feel them.
Really feel them.
The nail beds.
The knuckle joints.
The soft pads where you have pressed against the earth ten thousand times.
And as you exhale, let them go slack.
Let them be dumb, happy creatures who have forgotten how to grip.
Heavy.
Warm.
Melting into the surface beneath you like wax softening in a patient flame.
The soles of your feet release next.
The arches, those elegant bridges that carry you, unclench.
The heels grow dense, weighted, sinking deeper into rest.
The tops of your feet smooth out.
Even the ankles—those hinges of a thousand steps—loosen their hold.
You couldn't stand now if you tried.
You wouldn't want to.
The calves are next.
Feel them now, these muscles that have climbed and descended, that have tensed in cold water and ached after long walks.
They are tired.
They have earned this.
Let the tension drain from them as if someone pulled a plug at your heel and everything that held them tight is flowing out, out, away.
They become soft.
They become meat and bone with nothing to prove.
Your knees settle.
Strange joints, knees—so often ignored until they hurt.
Now they are simply hinges in the open position, asking nothing.
And above them, your thighs.
The fronts of your thighs, where tension lives in wait.
The backs of your thighs, pressed into what holds you.
The inner thighs, that private geography, letting go of whatever guard they keep.
Heavy.
So heavy.
Your legs have become sandbags, warm and weighted, belonging entirely to the floor.
The hips now.
The pelvis.
This bowl of bone that holds your core, your center, your seat of power.
Feel it cradle you from within even as you are cradled from without.
The hip flexors—those tight, angry creatures for anyone who sits too long—soften.
The sacrum presses into the surface beneath you like a hand greeting an old friend.
The bowl tips toward stillness, toward equilibrium.
You are settling into your own foundation.
And the belly.
Oh, the belly.
The place you suck in, the place you armor, the soft round truth of you that rarely gets to simply exist.
Let it go.
Let it rise with your inhale like bread in a warm oven, let it fall with your exhale like a sigh made flesh.
No one is looking.
No one is measuring.
Your belly is allowed to be exactly what it is: alive, soft, breathing.
The organs beneath it settle into their work, grateful for the space.
Your lower back releases its arch, just slightly, finding its own neutral.
The muscles that run along your spine, those ropes of tension, begin to unwind.
Your middle back, the space behind your heart, softens.
Your upper back, those muscles that hunch over keyboards and curl around worries, melt into the support beneath them.
You are spreading.
You are becoming wider, longer, less defined at the edges.
Your shoulders drop.
You didn't know they were up around your ears, but they were, weren't they?
They always are.
Now they fall away from your neck like stones released from a tired fist.
Heavy.
So heavy.
The collarbone widens.
The chest opens without effort, simply because there is room now, because the shoulders have stopped guarding it.
Feel the relaxation flow down your arms.
Your upper arms, your triceps and biceps, become soft and useless.
Your elbows, those points of articulation, rest easy.
Your forearms, the muscles that grip and type and carry, let go of their perpetual readiness.
Your wrists settle.
Your hands—your busy, clever hands—fall open.
The palms turn up, perhaps, or they rest however they've landed.
The fingers curl slightly, like the legs of a creature surrendered to sleep.
The thumbs no longer need to oppose anything.
You are not holding on.
You are not reaching.
You are simply here.
The throat relaxes.
That narrow passage where so many words have traveled, where you have swallowed things you could not say—it softens.
The muscles around your voicebox release their subtle grip.
You do not need to speak.
You do not need to swallow anything but ease.
Your jaw.
Your jaw, that hinge of tension, that lockbox for every frustration you could not scream.
Let it drop.
Let your lips part slightly, let there be space between your teeth.
The masseter muscles—those rocks you've grown along your jawline—become butter in the sun.
Your tongue falls away from the roof of your mouth, rests like a heavy thing on the floor of your mouth, asking nothing, saying nothing.
The muscles around your mouth soften.
The ones that smile politely, that hold back what you really want to say.
They rest.
Your cheeks become slack, heavy, uninstructed.
The little muscles around your nose release their tiny grip.
And your eyes, behind their closed lids.
The tiny muscles that control focus, that dart and seek and read—they go still.
Your eyes roll slightly downward, toward rest, toward darkness.
The eyelids become heavy blankets, and beneath them, nothing is required.
No looking.
No seeing.
Just the pleasant dark, the warm cave of your own skull.
Your forehead smooths.
The lines of worry and concentration ease, as if someone pressed a warm palm to your brow and said it's alright.
The temples release their subtle throb.
Your scalp loosens, the skin over your skull growing soft, the tension you didn't know you carried in your very hair follicles finally dissipating.
The crown of your head.
The very top of you.
Feel it open, somehow, as if the tension that held you together has become unnecessary, and now you are simply a vessel, open at both ends, breath moving through you like wind through an empty room.
You are heavy now.
So heavy.
Your body has become a thing that belongs to the floor, to the bed, to whatever holds you.
You couldn't lift your arm if you wanted to.
You couldn't turn your head.
And you don't want to.
This heaviness is a gift.
This heaviness is the weight of permission.
The world outside this room continues without you.
Cars move through streets.
Clocks tick their pointless measurements.
Other people hurry toward their destinations.
But you are not there.
You are here.
You are nowhere but inside your own softening body, nowhere but in this breath that rises and falls with the patience of tides.
You are floating and sinking at the same time.
Held by what is beneath you, open to what is above you.
You have crossed a threshold without moving at all.
You have left the loud, demanding world and entered a space where nothing is required of you but this: breathe, and soften, and let yourself be carried deeper.
The journey is just beginning.
But already, you are ready.
Already, you are that warm, heavy, breathing thing that knows how to let go.
Already, you are exactly where you need to be.
